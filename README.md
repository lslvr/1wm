# mwm

For the true minimalist:

- ~40 LOC.
- No default keybindings (just edit the source).
- No title bars, no status bars, no buttons, no borders, no menus, etc.
- No mouse control.
- No virtual desktops.
- No configuration files.
- Absolutely adabptable to your needs.
- Includes just what is strictly needed.
- Not standards compliant (because, honestly, who gives a fuck?).
- All windows are full-screen, just one is visible at any given time.

Two macros are available for assigning keybindings: `grab` and `K`.
Read the source for an example on how to use them (my own setup).

Dead simple.
